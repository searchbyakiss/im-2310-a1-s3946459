      <div class="Introduction"><h4>Introduction:</h4> The Tomie series was first created by Japanese horror manga master Junji Ito, and was also Ito's debut work.
        First serialised in 1988, the manga has become a classic of today's horror manga with its violent, gory and fantastically imaginative storytelling and drawing style, with Tomie, the heroine, being the classic of all.</div>

      <div class="Character"><h4>Character: </h4>Kawakami Tomie is a very beautiful woman, but she is also vain, arrogant and unpredictable. Tomie's identity is mysterious. She can reproduce endlessly from the cells of her body and has the ability to multiply indefinitely like a piece of leech.</div>

      <div class="Reviews"><h4>Reviews:</h4>The reason why this series of manga is so highly regarded as a masterpiece by Junji Ito and a classic of horror manga is that it does more than just be scary and unpleasant for the reader. First of all, Tomie, as the heroine, is beautiful and frivolous, seducing all men with impunity, which is indeed detestable as a woman; but at the same time, she has to suffer the pain of death and then be reborn after being abused and dismembered by different men over and over again. ...... This makes the reader somewhat sympathetic to her. The fact that she has a little sympathy for her, and at the same time understands in her heart that not being a good person will not be rewarded, and even if she can stay alive she can only exist in such a monstrous way, is more or less a warning.
        Then look at the many protagonists in this series. There are men and women, young people and old people and children. It can be said that different people display different flaws in human nature. Most of the men who adore Tomie die in vain, and the rest go mad. In fact, there are women like Tomie in real life, just not as exaggerated, but the ones who end up suffering the most are themselves. Young girls who envy Tomie's beauty and try to become her will find that their true character is more appealing when they become beautiful.</div>

      <div class="Introduction"><h4>Introduction:</h4> 5cm per Second is a realistic animated film by Makoto Shinkai.

      <div class="Reviews"><h4>Reviews:</h4>5cm per Second is a durable animated film. The most striking aspect of the film's form is its depiction of detail: the realism of light and shadow, the reflection of tree branches in standing water, the ripples caused by flower petals falling on the water; the graphic sound, the quiet and ethereal soundtrack; the slow switching of images with the implicit words of the letter, the right sense of rhythm.</div>

      <div class="Character"><h4>Character: </h4>Chihiro Ogiano / sen :
        The central character of this film is a 10-year-old fourth-grade girl with a disinterested and unmotivated personality.
        <br>The White Dragon (Haku):
        He was originally the god of a river called the "Amber River" (コハク川), and his original form was that of a dragon and he could change his appearance to that of a 12-year-old boy.</div>

      <div class="Reviews"><h4>Reviews:</h4> Through the story of Chihiro, the film tells the growth process of facing the society alone in an in-depth and simple way. It is a "growth gift" given by Hayao Miyazaki to audiences of all ages. At the time of the college entrance examination, for candidates who are about to step into the society, "Qian and Qianxun" is also an excellent "coming-of-age ceremony". In the first stage of growth, everyone will experience the panic of entering a strange environment, just like the panic of Qianxun entering the hidden world for the first time. In the second stage, people will encounter temptations and make choices. Just like in the soup house, some people sink into monsters like a faceless man, and some people have always sticking to their original heart like Chihiro. The third stage is an unavoidable parting in growing up, just like the life train in the film. Everyone can only accompany you for a while, and you can only wave goodbye when someone gets out of the car.</div>

      <div class="Introduction"><h4>Introduction:</h4> "Strange Doctor Black Jack" is a cartoon created by Osamu Tezuka, the god of Japanese comics, in 1973. In the low tide of his life, he took this opportunity to criticise the society and was obscure and ironic. The protagonist of the work, "Black Jack", is an unaccredited surgeon. Although his medical skills are extremely excellent, he often raises huge surgical fees to patients (the basic price in the comics is usually 30 million yen). Osamu Tezuka used the contrast created by this role to vent his dissatisfaction with society, claiming that modern morality is "just a layer of vanity and gloom that covers up the facts". </div>

      <div class="Character"><h4>Character:</h4> Jack (Black. ジャック) The real name is Black Man, and this is the leading actor. Unacless surgical doctor. The medical skills are excellent, but the fees are extremely high, ranging from tens of millions to tens of billions. Despite this, he often does not take a penny or only a small fee for poor patients. He wears a black coat wherever he goes, with a scalpel and other medical equipment inside, and can throw back the enemy if necessary. When he was playing with his mother on the beach in his early years, he touched the unremoved unexploded bomb left by the U.S. military stationed and exploded. As a result, his mother died after being sent to the hospital, and Black Jack was almost completely broken. Jutōtaro's treatment and a large number of skin transplants survived (there were obvious post-operative scars on his face, and the black skin on his face was never removed to commemorate the only black friend Gao Zhi who encouraged him and donated skin at that time, but died accidentally due to the government's suppression of environmental protection organisations), so he aspired to be a Doctor, and revenge for his mother's death.</div>
